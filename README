* README * 

This is the repository of the development of the MsC thesis: Automatic Habitat Mapping using Machine Learning. This repository contains programs that use Computer Vision techniques to deal with image enhancement and image noise in photos and sidescan sonar images. It may also contain some programs that handle the images in a file system. In the future will have the implementation of the ML predictive model (first approach will be CNNs).   

This program can be used to retrieve the photos from a ImagePositions.csv file in which you want the photos with roll and pitch to 7.2ยบ 
and the altitude limits are between 1.5 and 3 meters. These values can be changed within the execution of the program.

To use this program you need to have installed the libopencv2.4-jni and their dev libraries. The following command does just that:

    sudo apt-get install libopencv2.4-jni libopencv*-dev


After that just run the following command in the terminal:

	python filter1.py [path to your .csv file]

This program will create a directory called FilteredPhotos in your mra folder with the Original photos directory and with the respective 
Normalized directory with the images created using the CLAHE algorithm.

Have fun!
