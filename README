This program can be used to retrieve the photos from a ImagePositions.csv file in which you want the photos with roll and pitch to 7.2ยบ 
and the altitude limits are between 1.5 and 3 meters. These values can be changed within the execution of the program.

To use this program you need to have installed the libopencv2.4-jni and their dev libraries. The following command does just that:

    sudo apt-get install libopencv2.4-jni libopencv*-dev


After that just run the following command in the terminal:

	python filter1.py [path to your .csv file]

This program will create a directory called FilteredPhotos in your mra folder with the Original photos directory and with the respective 
Normalized directory with the images created using the CLAHE algorithm.

Have fun!
