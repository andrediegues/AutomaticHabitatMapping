This program can be used to retrieve the photos from a ImagePositions.csv file in which you want the photos with roll and pitch to 7.2ยบ 
and the altitude limits are between 1.5 and 3 meters. You can always modify this parameters by editing the variables in the main function 
on the file "filter.py":

	- desiredPitch
	- desiredRoll
	- bottomLimAltitude
	- upperLimAltitude

To use this program you simply extract the tar.gz file and write in the terminal:

	python filter1.py [path to your .csv file]

This program will create a directory called WantedPics in your mra folder with the original photos from the .csv file and with the respective 
retified images using the CLAHE algorithm.

Have fun!
